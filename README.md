## 1. **Project Title**
High-Speed CRC and Parallel CRC Accelerator for Reliable Network Protocols on Microwatt
## 2. Project Overview
This project implements a high-speed CRC accelerator in Verilof/VHDL, integrated with the open-source Mircowatt CPU as a memory-mapped peripheral. The accelerator supports parallel CRC computation, enabling significant speedup over software-only CRC for networrk protocols. A lightweight driver and benchmarks will demonstrate improved throughput and efficiency in error detection for reliable communication.
## 3. Motivation and Problem Statement
In modern network communication, error detection is essential to ensure data integrity. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a widely used mechanism for detecting errors in transmitted data. However, traditional CRC implementations can become a performance bottleneck in high-speed systems, especially when implemented purely in software.

The goal of this project is to design and integrate a **hardware-accelerated CRC unit** (including parallel CRC computation support) with the open-source Microwatt CPU core. This accelerator will significantly reduce latency and increase throughput for error detection in network protocol applications.

## 4. Objectives
- Implement a **CRC computation accelerator** in Verilog/VHDL.  
- Support **parallel CRC calculation** for multiple bytes per clock cycle.  
- Integrate the accelerator as a **memory-mapped peripheral** to Microwatt.   
- Provide testbenches and simulation results.

## 6. Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Study CRC algorithms and parallel computation methods.  
2. **Hardware Design**: Implement CRC accelerator (serial + parallel) in Verilog/VHDL and header parser FSM.  
3. **Integration**: Connect accelerator to Microwatt via memory-mapped registers (Wishbone or AXI-lite style). API: input buffer pointer, length, start, status, CRC_OUT, parsed fields.  
4. **Software Support**: Write driver in C for Microwatt that:
   - Allocates/points to packet buffer
   - Writes commands to registers
   - Polls/handles interrupt on completion
   - Compares hardware CRC with software CRC for validation
## 7. Proposed Solution
To overcome the performance bottlenecks of software-based CRC in high-speed networking, we propose designing a hardware-accelerated CRC engine with parallel computation capability. The accelerator will be implemented in Verilog/VHDL and connected to the Microwatt CPU as a memory-mapped peripheral via Wishbone/AXI-lite bus.
Key aspects of the solution include:
-Parallel CRC Computation: Support multiple bytes per clock cycle to increase throughput.
-Memory-Mapped Interface: Expose simple control/status registers (e.g., START, STATUS, CRC_OUT) for CPU interaction.
-Software Driver Support: Provide C/assembly routines for Microwatt to offload CRC calculations easily.
-End-to-End Integration: Validate the design using testbenches, known CRC test vectors, and performance benchmarks against software-only implementations.
-Extensibility: The design will be modular, allowing future extensions such as DMA-based packet streaming or multi-polynomial CRC support.

This solution ensures reliable, fast, and efficient error detection for network protocols while showcasing hardware/software co-design on the Microwatt platform.

## 8. Expected outcomes
- Verilog/VHDL source for CRC & parser (synthesizable).  
- Testbenches and sample packet traces.  
- Microwatt integration wrapper (bus interface).  
- C driver + example applications.  
- README, design notes, and performance report.
